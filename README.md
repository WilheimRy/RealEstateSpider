# RealEstateSpider
A powerful spider utilizing Scrapy automatically download real estate information(text &amp; images). It goes recursively into the end page to download every useful info inside individual page.

This spider uses Scrapy, which utilizes asynchronous programming, therefore, it's very fast. Based on my testing, it's 10 times faster than using the Request lib.

This spider for non-commercial use only. Explanation is by the author only.
